1. Find the average score
A program is needed to prompt the user operator for ten exam scores, 
calculate the average score and display the result to the screen. 
The average score is calculated as the sum of the scores divided by the number of scores.

Module Main
	Declare Integer sum = 0
	Declare Integer examCount = 0
	Declare Integer score
	Declare Integer result
	
	While (examCount < 10)
		Input score
		Set sum = sum + score
		Set examCount = examCount + 1
	EndWhile
	
	If (examCount == 10)
		Set result = sum / examCount
		Print result
End Main



2. How much water runs off the roof
How much water runs off a roof in a rain storm?

To calculate the runoff from any given rainfall: 
Take the dimensions of the footprint of the roof and convert them to inches. (So, a 50' x 20' roof is 600" x 240"). 
Multiply the roof dimensions by the number of inches of rainfall. 
In this example, 600" x 240" x 1" = 144,000 cubic inches of water. 
Divide that result by 231 to get the number of gallons (because 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches). (144,000/231 = 623.38).

Write the pseudocode for the above problem. 
If you use the numbers provided in the example then the correct pseudocode will calculate the same result.
